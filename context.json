  "summary": "This page presents the clinical validation methodology and performance results for the Hyfe AI cough monitoring system. Hyfe uses continuous acoustic recording to automatically detect and count coughs, and this validation demonstrates the agreement between Hyfe's automated counts and human-annotated ground truth across 23 participants in a multicenter study. The primary statistical framework uses Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) rather than Pearson r alone, because CCC jointly measures both precision and accuracy — capturing systematic bias that a correlation coefficient would miss. Validation covers three levels: event-level detection (sensitivity, false positives per hour), hourly cough rate agreement (CCC, Bland-Altman), and daily total cough count agreement (CCC, Bland-Altman). The dataset reflects real-world acoustic conditions across home, workplace, and public settings, with dual independent annotation and expert adjudication as the reference standard. Results are intended to support regulatory and pharma endpoints committee review for use of Hyfe as a clinical trial endpoint instrument.",

    "Hourly cough rate CCC ≈ 0.962 (daily totals normalized to coughs/hour per participant)",

    "Ground truth established via dual independent human annotation + expert adjudication (not automated labeling)",
